          Bucket is the Schema for the buckets API
          The controller will try to create a bucket with the same name as the Bucket resource,
          it will also create a user and the policy giving read/write access to the bucket.
          It will then create a secret with the credentials the user's service account credentials:
          MINIO_ACCESS_KEY: the account's access key
          MINIO_SECRET_KEY: the account's secret key
          MINIO_ENDPOINT: the endpoint of the minio server
          MINIO_BUCKET: the name of the bucket
          MINIO_SECURE: whether the connection to the minio server should be secure
