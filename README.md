# minio-bucket-controller

A simple controller to create buckets and corresponding users in MinIO.

**Note**: *The controller does not intend to be a replacement for the [COSI](https://container-object-storage-interface.github.io/) project.
It is not as structured and does not have the same level of abstraction as the COSI.
It is not meant to be a generic bucket controller, but rather a simple controller to create app buckets and users in MinIO.
It covers a specific need: manage application's MinIO buckets and access lifecycle inside Kubernetes*

## Description

This controller allows to manage buckets directly from Kubernetes:

```yaml
apiVersion: s3.linka.cloud/v1alpha1
kind: Bucket
metadata:
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: bucket
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: bucket-sample
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: minio-bucket-controller
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: kustomize
    app.kubernetes.io/created-by: minio-bucket-controller
  name: bucket-sample
spec:
  reclaimPolicy: Delete
  secretName: bucket-sample-creds
```

When a new bucket resource is created, the corresponding minio bucket is created 
with a new user `bucket.s3.linka.cloud/bucket-sample` and an assigned policy that allows read/write access to the bucket only:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
        "s3:GetBucketLocation",
        "s3:ListBucket"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::${BUCKET}"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:*"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::${BUCKET}/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Then a service account is created for the user.
The service account credentials are stored in a secret:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: ${BUCKET}-bucket-credentials
  namespace: $NAMESPACE
stringData:
  MINIO_ACCESS_KEY: $ACCESS_KEY
  MINIO_SECRET_KEY: $SECRET_KEY
  MINIO_ENDPOINT: $ENDPOINT
  MINIO_BUCKET: $BUCKET
  MINIO_SECURE: $SECURE
```



## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Preparation

#### Create a MinIO Service Account for the controller

You need to have a MinIO user with the right permissions (e.g. console admin) for the controller service account.

If you don't have one, you can create one with the following command:

```sh
mc admin user add myminio myminio-admin myminio-password
```

Assign the policy `consoleAdmin` to the user:

```sh
mc admin policy set myminio consoleAdmin user=myminio-admin
```

Create the controller service account:

```sh
mc admin user svcacct add myminio myminio-admin

Access Key: <ACCESS_KEY>
Secret Key: <SECRET_KEY>
```

Create a `policy.json` file with the service account IAM definition:

```shell
cat <<EOF > policy.json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "admin:CreateUser",
        "admin:DeleteUser",
        "admin:ListUsers",
        "admin:CreatePolicy",
        "admin:DeletePolicy",
        "admin:GetPolicy",
        "admin:ListUserPolicies",
        "admin:CreateServiceAccount",
        "admin:UpdateServiceAccount",
        "admin:RemoveServiceAccount",
        "admin:ListServiceAccounts"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:CreateBucket",
        "s3:DeleteBucket",
        "s3:ForceDeleteBucket,
        "s3:ListAllMyBuckets"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
EOF

Then assign the policy to the service account:

```sh
mc admin user svcacct edit myminio <ACCESS_KEY> --policy policy.json
```

### Running on the cluster

#### Install Custom Resources and deploy the controller

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linka-cloud/minio-bucket-controller/main/manifests.yaml
```

The controller will not be created as it requires a secret named **minio-bucket-controller-credentials** with the MinIO credentials.

Then create a secret with the credentials:

```sh
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: minio-bucket-controller-credentials
  namespace: minio-bucket-controller-system
stringData:
  MINIO_ACCESS_KEY: <ACCESS_KEY>
  MINIO_SECRET_KEY: <SECRET_KEY>
  MINIO_ENDPOINT: myminio:9000
  # uncomment if you don't use tls
  # MINIO_INSECURE: "true"
EOF
```
